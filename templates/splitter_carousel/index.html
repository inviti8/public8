                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>I opened my right eye a little, since I figure Lexi must've gotten their attention. They've both turned away. The one holding the skull saw is short and chubby, kinda greasy looking. A white dude with his hair shaved in a bleach blonde polka-dot pattern. He has a gothic number eighteen under his left eye, and a triangular glow tat on the back of his neck, probably a neuropatch implant. He is wearing a jeweled letter “R” around his neck on a thick chain. Its sitting squarely in the middle of his “King Rufus” shirt. The other guy has a strong build, square jaw and a bald head. Id guess he might be Puerto Rican. He isn't really flashy, white tee and jeans. He has a glow tat that looks like the number eighteen written in circuit-like pattern on the back of his neck that stands out, also likely a neuropatch implant. The eighteen tells me they are Thrall Eights… So I must be on the outskirts of Federal City. Whoever hit me was either too cheap or didn't respect me enough to send professionals. Looks like I'm inside a parking garage of some kind. It's mostly empty and pretty dilapidated. The two thugs are looking in the direction of Lexi, who is drunkenly stumbling down the ramp.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>Eyes glazed over he nods looking slightly nervous, and grimacing as though he wants to say something but he can't. He's changed his manner of speaking, which tells me whoever the client is… He isnt street level.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>

I feel my heartstrings. The os acceptance chime rings out.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>The effect is instantaneous and I feel energized. I pull out my gun. A seventy caliber magnetic propulsion pistol with an internally embedded smart seek processor and custom firmware. Capacity of twenty-two multi purpose zero point rounds. Based loosely on the Chiappa Rhino in aesthetics. It's a modification of my own design. I'll need information from one of these guys so can get these hitters off me. Chubby is empty, square jaw is the real threat here. He seems like he has the most information of the two, so I'll need to keep his head intact. I take aim and fire. The round hits him heavily, close to his left shoulder blade. He flies forward in a pirouette. Chubby immediately runs for Lexi, grabbing her to use her for a shield. To my surprise, square jaw is pulling himself to his feet, reaching for his gun. He must be wearing armor… smarter than me. I'll need to empty the clip in the same spot to get penetration.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>

                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>Immediately Lexi straightens her body, lifts her left foot and drives her heel hard into chubbys foot. “FUCK!” he yells out.  She twists away from his grasp and turns to face him. He looks at her, puzzled, then she quickly pulls back her right arm and swings, striking him in the face.  The blow hits him hard causing him to lurch to the left, at the same time Lexis right fist bifurcates, her ring and pinky fingers collapsing into her palm, tearing her silicon skin, and releasing a light spray of clearish fluid.  Lexies are not very durable, and definitely not designed for fighting.  I created the Danger-Angel program to be run on the latest Eden model, so this might not work out as well as I'd hoped.  Chubby, stumbles back, somewhat dazed.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>He swings hard, Lexi tries to duck but the strike catches her just above her temple. I see her head buckle to the left at a sharp angle, causing her to stumble several steps. She recovers, but the punch tore back the skin at the edge of her hairline. He swings again, this time she dodges it and uppercuts to his chin with her damaged fist. As he stumbles back, she hits him three more times in the side of the head with her damaged hand.  The third blow causes her hand to almost completely break off her wrist.  Chubby buckles slightly, takes a few steps back, then stands up straight.  He touches his busted bottom lip with his fingers, looking at the blood. Smiling, he says, “That just ain't gonna do it, baby.”  Lexi peels back what's left of right her hand and is clenching the end of her severed wrist tightly.  Chubby rushes her fast... He is right upon her when she releases her severed wrist from her grip, swinging it right in front of his face.  The clearish liquid sprays out, coating his face.  He trips then drops to his knees, holding his eyes.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>Then deliberately and without hesitation Lexi walks up to him, wraps her right leg around his head,  hooking her toe behind her left thigh. She then plunges her left good hand into chubbys open mouth. She pushes down hard until her slender arm is inside past the elbow.  Then she releases the grip around his head, placing her foot on his shoulder, she kicks him back. As he falls back, she pulls out from his mouth a bloody mass of what look like intestines. As he lays the jiggling in his final throes, I actually feel sorry for him.  I hadn't expected that.  The method she used was completely outside of main tactics protocol.  That must've been neural net improvisation.  The cold gruesomeness actually scares me a bit. I know this is just an alternate program running. Still, she is a horrifying sight. Standing there, her eyes still and her face stoic, with a blood soaked arm and a fist full of torn intestines.  I actually feel a primal urge not to get close to her.  I want to shut down the program, but I also want to examine her decision tree.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>I feel more alert as the adrenaline kicks in. As I raise my hand to shield my eyes from the spotlight, two smoothed angular forms in shadow approach. They are federal droids. Tall and slender, with white silicon based armor. Their heads are in the shape of an elongated pentagon, with a black rectangle running up the center.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>“You have no jurisdiction, I will no longer respond to your requests. I will not comply.”</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>I ignore it, and lean down, pausing for a second. I don't like killing… only had to do it once before, seeing this person laying here my heart feel a little heavy. But it was him or me I tell myself… I take a breath, then enclose his head within the skull saw. I've never actually done this, only heard about it. I hesitate before activating, looking to the side so the device is slightly out of my peripheral vision then activate. With a click then a low hum, red lights light up on the front of the device. Then, a split second later the light turns green, I didnt feel anything but somehow the head has been separated. The neck completely cauterized, no blood. Then another click and hiss a smoothed rectangular box ejects from the top. That was easy. I grab the box, leaving the device.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>It seems to take forever for me to reach the top of the ramp.  My car waiting at the curb never looked so good.  It looks like I'm in on the northside of the Federal City slums, not too far from the massive front gate. Its sunrise, the sun is coming up behind the skyline above me, everything tinted in blue green shadow.  Looking past the vast mass of stacked rectangles and cubes of the slums in my immediate view. I see the battered, vandalized walls of the main city.  The tech-nouveau style winged sphinx looking down on the haphazard pile of boxes dotted with Holo-Ads blinking, rising, and disappearing intermittently.  The federal droid stayed with me all the way to the street.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
                        
                        <ons-carousel-item overflow-y: scroll; height:90vh;><div class="page" > <p>The low whir of the zero drive engages. I climb upward past the stacked shanties and modified storage units.  The gray walled citadel of shone in shadow before me.  As my car banks right, the pinkish sun peeks from behind the slender sturdy tower at the center of the city.  The slums below look like a vast junkyard, as I climb they shrink away.  I look at the horizon colored from bottom to top in magenta then orange, then to black as I slowly nod off.</p> </div></ons-carousel-item>

He was far before the time of any real autonomous robotics systems, but he imagined that humanity would build robots to follow what he coined as The three laws of robotics, first and foremost being that: A robot may not injure a human being through either action or inaction.  So optimistic...  Needless to say, the very first thing those in power did with autonomous robotic systems was to use them to impose tyranny over the people.  Maxim grew up during very dark times.  The earth was in an Ice Age, he lived in a time of great starvation and turmoil.. People rose against the government, but countless were exterminated by military automatons, maintaining complete tyranny.  </p> </div></ons-carousel-item>
